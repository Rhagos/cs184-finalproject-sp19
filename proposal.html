Title: Gun Range Simulation
Summary: This VR application brings players to a simulated gun range where they can use a variety of firearms with several different attachments. Players can customize the range environment, targets, and other parameters to suit their preferences and needs.
Team members: Benjamin Wu, Daniel Wu, Charles Hager
Problem Description

Firearm training is inaccessible to some people due to factors such as location, cost, hassle, and safety, all of which is compounded for novice shooters. A virtual reality gun range is a great first step for those who want to learn to handle firearms, as it is a risk-free and beginner-friendly environment to practice.
Goals and Deliverables

Interactive demo: Player starts at a gun range with firearms on a table in front of them, and targets at various distances behind the table. The player can pick up, interact with the operations of, and fire the guns.
Minimum requirements:
Optical attachments for certain guns
Magnifying sight for hunting rifle
Holographic sight for semi-automatic rifle
Basic gun range environment map
Flat terrain
Targets
Table
Skybox and map borders
Basic gun sounds
Basic bullet raycasting
Basic gun functionality and animations:
Physics - gravity, collisions
Releasing and reloading magazines
Pulling the slide back and cycling a bullet
One of each major type of consumer firearm:
1 semi-automatic pistol
1 pump-action hunting shotgun
1 bolt-action hunting rifle
1 semi-automatic rifle
Pure graphics components:
Optical sights
Holographic sight: mimicking the “infinity effect” transmission hologram
Magnifying sight: second camera rendering with higher FoV, or custom magnifying shader
Inverse kinematic arms for realistic arm movement
2: Hope to deliver
Custom shaders for Unity
Custom textures for surfaces
Modular attachment system
Wider variety of firearms: revolvers, fully automatic weapons, military weapons
Schedule
Week 1:
Graphics:
All props and models should be found/modeled and added to a Unity scene
Inverse kinematic system on a character rig should be started
Interaction:
Player should be able to move around the map and pick up and drop the guns
Week 2:
Graphics:
Inverse kinematics should be finished, and player model should have arms
Gun animations should be started
Holographic and magnifying optical sights should be started
Interaction:
Gun mechanics should be finished
Week 3:
Graphics:
Gun animations should be finished
Sights should be finished and added to weapon models
Interaction:
Fluff map props and alternate environments should be added, along with a system to switch environments
Week 4:
Mainly a buffer week for unfinished miscellaneous tasks
Work on “hope to deliver” goals
