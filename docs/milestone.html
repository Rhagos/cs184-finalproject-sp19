<h1 align="middle">Final Project Milestone</h1>
<h2 align="middle">Gun Range Simulation</h2> <br />

<h3>Project Summary: </h3>
This VR application brings players to a simulated gun range where they can use a variety of firearms with several different attachments. <br />
Players can customize the range environment, targets, and other parameters to suit their preferences and needs. <br />
Firearm training is inaccessible to some people due to factors such as location, cost, hassle, and safety, all of which is compounded for novice shooters. <br />
A virtual reality gun range is a great first step for those who want to learn to handle firearms, as it is a risk-free and beginner-friendly environment to practice. <br />


<h2>Current Accomplishments: </h2>

<ul>
    <li>Preliminary environment scene</li>
    <li>Pistol model + animations</li>
    <li>Physical interactions with the pistol (collisions, gravity)</li>
    <li>Script for firing and raycasting bullets</li>
    <li>Functional gun range target placeholders</li>
    <li>Pistol firing and proper animation interactions</li>
    <li>Significant progress on inverse kinematics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preliminary results: </h2>

<ul>
    <li>Player can pick up and fire a pistol at targets using any hand.</li>
    <li>Targets react properly upon being hit (placeholder targets)</li>
    <li>Inverse Kinematic solver has 2D functionality with arm-hand movement. Hand rotation to be worked out later.</li>

    <li>Basic gun functionality:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Firing and playing animations are implemented</li>
        <li>Other interactions (reloading, chambering, changing firing mode) are not yet implemented. </li>
    </ul>

</ul>

<h2>Work Plan</h2>
<ul>
    <li> <h3>Week 3:</h3> </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Implemented Magnifying scope</li>
        <li>Started Holographic scope</li>
        <li>IK solver rotates arms to match hand rotations</li>
        <li>IK solver implemented with touch controller inputs</li>
        <li>Rifle added as an additional firearm</li>
    </ul>
    <li> <h3>Week 4:</h3> </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Holographic sight finished</li>
        <li>Additional gun types added</li>
        <li>Additional gun interactions (reloading, chambering, etc.) implemented</li>
        <li>Arm models finished and integrated into Inverse Kinematic solver</li>
